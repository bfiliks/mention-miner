## 19. Ted Underwood
- **strength**: 11  |  **degree**: 8  |  **betweenness**: 0.004  |  **community**: 1
- **Contexts:**
  - Sarah E. Bond, Hoyt Long, and Ted Underwood respond by pointing out the ways in which computational
tools (modeling in particular) have developed beyond frequency counts.1 Da claims that the statis-
tical principles underlying several prominent DH publications are unsound.
  - For example, in Ted Underwood, David Bamman, and Sabrina Lee’s article “The Transformation of Gender
in English-Language Fiction” (2018), the authors remark that they don’t pretend to have fully
explained the paradoxes in their data.

## 22. Andrew Piper
- **strength**: 5  |  **degree**: 5  |  **betweenness**: 0.002  |  **community**: 1
- **Contexts:**
  - Andrew Piper, Ben Schmidt, and others counter that Da has misunderstood and misused their methods.2
This antagonism over methodological validity is reflected in the recent, productive push (from
inside and outside of DH) toward transparency.

## 23. Timothy Brennan
- **strength**: 4  |  **degree**: 4  |  **betweenness**: 0.000  |  **community**: 1
- **Contexts:**
  - In a piece for the Chronicle of Higher Education, Timothy Brennan links the rise of DH with the
downfall of the humanities, noting that DH has “turned many humanists into establishment curators
and made critical thought a form of planned obsolescence” (2017).

  - Violet Blue bitingly remarks that the Gabi Kirilloff | ESSAYS 7tool will “be a hit with the alt
right” while Robert Epstein considers Perspective the perfect illustration of the “stupidity” of
contemporary AI—proof that we do not need to worry about the singularity just yet
(2017).Unfortunately, Google’s rationale for creating Perspective received less attention.
